# Suleiman Msaba

Personal portfolio: websites, Android apps and business systems, built in Dar es Salaam. English and Kiswahili.

Built with Vue 3 and Vite. The finished site is plain static files, so it can be hosted for free.

## Run it locally

```bash
npm install
npm run dev      # http://localhost:3000
npm run build    # production files in dist/
npm run preview  # check the production build
```

## Edit the content

Everything the site says is in `src/content.js`, in English (`en`) and Kiswahili (`sw`):

- `profile.links`: email, WhatsApp, GitHub, LinkedIn and CV. Empty links are hidden.
- `projects`: name, type, status, summary, link and images. Images live in `public/work/`.
- `experience`: organization, role and dates.

Visitors can switch language with EN / SW, or you can share a link that opens in Kiswahili: `?lang=sw`.

## Publish for free

**GitHub Pages (already set up).** In the repository on GitHub, open *Settings → Pages* and set *Source* to *GitHub Actions*. Every push to `main` then publishes the site to `https://sulemsaba.github.io/pot4lio/`.

**Netlify, Vercel or Cloudflare Pages.** Import the repository, use the build command `npm run build` and the output folder `dist`. Set the environment variable `SITE_URL` to the final address (for example `https://suleiman.netlify.app`) so link previews on WhatsApp and LinkedIn show the right image.
